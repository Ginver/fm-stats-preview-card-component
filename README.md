# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

![Design preview for the Stats preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My biggest challenge in this project was to get the purple filter on the picture. 
So thank you for this challenge becouse now I am familiar with the 'background-blend-mode' property in CSS.
